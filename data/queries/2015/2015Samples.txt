# This file contains SAMPLE topics for the TREC 2015 Microblog track
# in the format that will be used for the test topics.  While there are
# no relevance judgments specific to these topics, they were each inspired
# by other topics from previous years that do have relevance judgments
# (crossword puzzle tournaments by MB165 "ACPT Crossword Tournament",
# airline mergers by MB172 "Merging of US Air and American" and
# statin side effects by MB173 "muscle pain from statins").

# Our expectation is that the set of 250 (or so) test topics will contain
# related sets of topics that differ in one facet. For example,
# we could have a set of merger topics that differ by the industry being
# targeted.  The idea is that there will be sufficient tweets to make it
# a good topic if a corresponding event happens during the test period,
# but not otherwise.  A topic that happens to have a trigger event
# in the test period will be included in the evaluation set, while most
# others will not be.  (We will include some topics that don't have
# a triggering event in the test period just to make sure systems can 
# recognize when no response is the correct response.)
